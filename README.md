# 1FSK-Modulation-Demodulation
The repository contains code to show modulation/demodulation procedures to data transmitting via DAC-ADC channel

## General information
The main purpose of this repository is given information about basic principles of 1FSK modulation and demodulation using DAC and ADC to generate and receive data signal. These basics may be usefull in more sirious projets like wireless data tranmitting

## Detailed overview

### Modulation and sending

### Receiving

### Demodulation
